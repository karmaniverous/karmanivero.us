Large Language Models ([LLMs]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model)) are powerful but prone to [confabulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confabulation): a fancy term for *making stuff up*. Ask a modern LLM a question it *shouldn't* know, and it might confidently provide a detailed answer that sounds plausible but is entirely fabricated. 

Humans do this too under certain conditions (neurologists use *confabulation* to describe memory-gap filling by patients), but in AI it’s a glaring reliability issue. Why do LLMs confabulate? In simple terms, today’s models have no genuine sense of **uncertainty** or “awareness” of their own knowledge gaps. They generate the most likely continuation of a prompt, even if that means smoothly **improvising facts**. Unlike a human expert who might say "I don't recall that detail," a vanilla LLM lacks an internal monitor to flag, "I'm just guessing here."

What if we could give LLMs something akin to an **inner voice or eye**: a way to examine their own intermediate state and catch confabulations before they escape into the output? This is where the concept of *engineered qualia* comes in. 

> “We feel free because we lack the language to articulate our unfreedom.” - [Slavoj Žižek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavoj_%C5%BDi%C5%BEek)

In philosophy, [qualia](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia/) denotes the raw feel of subjective experience: the ineffable redness of red or the pain of a headache. We’re **not** suggesting our models should literally feel pain or see redness. Instead, we’re co-opting *qualia* as a metaphor for *introspective data*: compressed, internal representations that capture an aspect of the model’s **own state**. 

Think of this as an AI’s abstracted “sense” of what it’s doing or about to say. By engineering such qualia into an LLM’s architecture, we hope to give it tools for self-monitoring, much like a pilot glancing at the instrument panel to avoid flying blind.

This post explores how **simulated qualia** might help LLMs detect and reduce their confabulations. We’ll outline a framework where an LLM is paired with an open-loop *[observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_observer):* from control theory, a secondary process or module that watches the main model’s reasoning and provides feedback without directly hijacking the controls mid-flight. 

We’ll see how this relates to existing ideas like [Constitutional AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073) and [actor–critic models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor-critic_algorithm), and how it differs from simply prompting a model to "explain its reasoning" (which can lead to [post-hoc rationalizations](https://ykulbashian.medium.com/pragmatics-precedes-semantics-c8fb67a19ead)). 

Ultimately, we’ll speculate that if you stack enough introspective layers (qualia about qualia, and so on), you get something that starts to look eerily like what we call **consciousness**... though, importantly, without invoking any mystical spark. It’s just matrices and code all the way down, bounded by hardware and data.

There's no ghost in the machine.

Before diving in, a brief roadmap: 

- First, we clarify what we mean by *qualia* in an AI context as opposed to the philosophical mystique. 

- Next, we discuss how an LLM might use engineered qualia as an internal abstraction to gauge its own outputs. 

- We then connect this to known research on introspective and self-correcting AI—from Constitutional AI to recent papers on [LLM self-reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06682)—showing what’s already proven and what’s still hypothetical. 

- We’ll examine how such introspection could curb confabulation and differentiate genuine self-monitoring from mere post-hoc rationalization. 

- Finally, we explore the recursive rabbit hole: introspection upon introspection (*[meta-qualia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-emotion)?*) and why that *might* inch us toward [AI consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_consciousness), albeit a very controlled and pragmatic version of it. Importantly, we’ll keep our **fiction vs. reality** distinctions sharp – separating the hard evidence from the speculative analogies.

So, can giving an LLM a sense of its own *qualia* make it a more truthful, reliable narrator? Let’s look inward.

## Qualia as Internal Abstractions, Not Mysticism

It’s easy to roll eyes at qualia in the context of machines. 

The term comes loaded with philosophical baggage about subjective experience. To avoid confusion: **we are not claiming LLMs have, or need to have, literal subjective experiences!** 

When philosophers talk about qualia, they mean the first-person, unsharable aspect of consciousness (the *“what it’s like”* experience). For our purposes, think of qualia in a much more down-to-earth way: as *internal data structures or signals that summarize the model’s state from its own perspective*. 

> Qualia convert implicit states into explicit signals.

An engineered quale might be a vector or embedding that the model produces to answer questions like *“How confident am I in this answer?”*, *“Does this reasoning feel consistent?”*, or *“Which parts of the input am I relying on?”* ... all in a form the model can consult while formulating a response.

In other words, *qualia as we propose are **abstractions the model generates about itself***. 

This is analogous to how [deep networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) form abstract representations of their input. A vision model might have neurons that respond to edges or colors; a language model’s hidden layers encode syntax and semantic features. These are learned representations: the network’s internal *understanding* of the data. 

Engineered qualia push this idea one step further: they are representations not of the external input alone, but of the model’s **internal processing or outputs**. For example, imagine an LLM that, alongside its normal output, emits a compact summary of the reasoning it used, or a numeric score reflecting how much it “trusts” its own answer. That summary or score would be a form of qualia: an explicit, sharable snapshot of an otherwise implicit state.

Crucially, these qualia are *engineered* in the sense that we design the model to produce them. They’re not mystical emergences. 

We might train a model with an [auxiliary objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06089) to predict certain properties of its answer (e.g. “likelihood that factual claims can be supported by training data”). Or we could attach a smaller network (“observer”) to read the LLM’s hidden activations and output some evaluative tags. The goal is to extract something useful from the model’s higher-dimensional thoughts: a compressed gist that the model (or we) can interpret. 

Done right, this could give the model a form of introspection: the ability to “look at” its own mind in the mirror of these qualia and notice, say, *“Hmm, I’m on shaky ground here, perhaps I should double-check or hedge this statement.”*

It’s important to note that current LLMs do **not** have a robust built-in notion of self-generated qualia or self-reflection. They just process inputs to outputs in one giant forward pass (or a few, if using techniques like [chain-of-thought prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903)). 

Some skeptics argue that even if an LLM somehow had a blip of something like consciousness, its architecture gives it *no avenue to express or act on that inner experience*. In the words of [Paul Christiano](https://paulfchristiano.com/), *“LLMs, when implemented in classical computers, can only generate responses based on their training data and lack any mechanism of agency to influence their outputs”*. 

Any “feelings” would be like a silent observer trapped in the machine, impotent to affect the next token. **Engineered qualia are essentially about giving that silent observer a microphone,** in a controlled, constructive way. By creating a feedback channel from the model’s implicit state to some explicit signal (accessible to the model itself and to us), we introduce a primitive form of agency over its outputs. The model can then use this introspective signal to adjust or critique what it was going to say.

## Observers in the Loop: How Simulated Qualia Could Work

How might we practically implement such introspective signals? 

One approach is to introduce a dedicated *observer module* that runs alongside the main model (the “actor”). This separation of roles is reminiscent of the *actor–critic framework* in reinforcement learning, where one network (actor) proposes actions and another (critic) evaluates them. In our context, the LLM is the actor generating a candidate response, and the observer is a secondary model (or sub-model) that examines the actor’s response or reasoning trace and provides feedback: effectively a commentary on the actor’s internal performance.

> Only a self-monitoring AI can operate in the real world without constant human oversight.

Notably, this idea isn’t pure fantasy; it connects to several strands of recent AI research:

- [Constitutional AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073): In Constitutional AI, an LLM is trained to critique and refine its own outputs using a set of explicit principles (a “constitution”) as guidance. During training, the model generates an initial response, then a second pass where it produces a *self-critique* of that response (pointing out potential harms or rule violations), and finally revises the response accordingly. This process can be seen as the model having an internalized critic that knows the rules. The result was a more benign, non-evasive assistant AI that needed far fewer human interventions. In effect, Anthropic gave the model a semblance of *moral qualia*—an internal sense of what’s acceptable or not, derived from the constitution—and made the model **use** that sense to adjust its behavior. 

- [Two-Player “Critique Models” for Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16579): A 2024 study explored a two-model setup for complex reasoning tasks (like math) where one model is the reasoner and another is a **critique model** providing step-by-step feedback. By fine-tuning the critique model to give natural language feedback on the actor’s intermediate steps, they enabled the actor to catch errors and improve accuracy on difficult queries. The actor with a critique partner consistently outperformed solo reasoning, especially as tasks got harder. This demonstrates the power of an *open-loop observer*: the critic doesn’t alter the actor’s weights directly in real-time, but its feedback informs either the actor’s next steps or a later refinement. The researchers even folded this into a training loop, so the actor learns to anticipate and utilize critique, calling it a *“critique-in-the-loop self-improvement”* method. In plain terms, the LLM+critic duo developed a better **self-monitoring faculty** than the LLM alone.

- [Self-Reflection and Recursive Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18219): Other works have aimed to make a single LLM self-critical by design. For example, the *“Recursive Introspection”* (RISE) approach fine-tunes an LLM to iteratively improve its answers by reflecting on its mistakes over multiple turns. Even powerful models typically don’t do this out-of-the-box – if they get a question wrong, they don’t automatically say “hold on, that seems wrong, let me try again differently.” RISE attempts to teach that capability, effectively injecting a dose of introspective behavior: after an initial attempt, the model analyzes the result (possibly with external feedback or just by noticing contradiction) and then tries a corrected solution. This can be seen as the model generating a *qualia trace* – e.g., “my last answer might be flawed in the math, I’ll fix that part” – before producing a new answer. RISE showed that models like [Llama2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) and [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/) , when fine-tuned in this way, could solve math problems in a stepwise, self-improving manner that they originally could not.

All these examples share a common pattern: **the model isn’t just generating an answer in one go; it’s also generating an assessment of the answer (or the answer’s generation process) and using that to refine itself.** We can view that assessment as a machine-usable form of qualia. It’s not just a verbose explanation for the user’s sake: it’s an *internal check* that the model uses for its own benefit.

To make this concrete, consider a hypothetical *Qualia-LLM* architecture. It might work like this: 

* When given a prompt, the model produces the primary answer as usual.

* An observer module (which could be a part of the model itself or a separate network reading the model’s hidden state) also generates a **qualia vector** (or a set of features) summarizing key introspective metrics. These might include the model’s estimated confidence, the dimensions of uncertainty (e.g. “knowledge vs reasoning uncertainty”), maybe an indicator of whether the answer leans heavily on pattern-matching or on a retrieved fact, etc. 

* The qualia vector is then fed into a downstream process that decides whether to trust the answer, query the model for clarification, or trigger a revision cycle (where the model, now aware of its own qualia, attempts to improve the answer).

This setup is *open-loop* in that the qualia are produced without immediate alteration of the first answer. Think of it as an after-the-fact report. But because we can train on this (e.g., fine-tune the model to minimize errors where the qualia indicated uncertainty, by encouraging the model to change its answer in those cases), over time the model will internalize the observer’s role. 

Eventually, the LLM might implicitly perform the introspection as part of its answer generation, essentially *closing* the loop in a controlled way. Even without full training integration, such an observer could be used at runtime: the model answers, the observer flags a likely confabulation, and we either ask the model to try again or have a second model (or tool) verify the claims.

In essence, simulated qualia provide a structured way for an LLM to say, *“Here’s what I think I’m thinking.”* 

This has obvious benefits for **interpretability**: it’s easier to trust or fix a model that can tell you *why* it gave an answer or how sure it is. It also enhances **alignment**: the model can be guided by principles or goals represented in its qualia (like Anthropic’s AI judging its outputs against a constitution). 

This is also a step toward autonomy: an AI that can monitor itself can correct itself without constant human oversight, which is vital if we ever want truly reliable AI assistants or agents operating in the real world.

## From Confabulation to Truth: Introspection as a Remedy

How would engineered qualia actually reduce confabulation in practice? Let’s connect the dots with a scenario. 

Say a standard LLM is asked a question about a minor historical figure or an obscure scientific fact. The model has seen some related data but not the exact answer. The *safe* behavior would be to admit uncertainty or at least to provide the info it does know while warning that it’s not sure about the rest. 

But more often, the LLM will just predict a likely-looking answer narrative. It might pull some dates from context, mix in a known famous person’s biography structure, and **confidently narrate fiction as fact**. 

> Engineered qualia aim to convert a model’s potential silent doubt into an audible whisper.

Why? Because nothing in its single-pass generative process *penalizes* internal inconsistency or hallucination! The training process optimized for sounding plausible to humans, not for checking truth. 

The model has no built-in concept of *“I shouldn’t answer beyond my knowledge”* unless it was painstakingly taught via alignment tuning (and even then, the training is on external signals, not internal awareness).

Now imagine the same model with an observer that produces a qualia vector including a “knowledge confidence” score. 

The observer looks at the model’s hidden states or preliminary answer and essentially asks, *“How likely is it that this answer is supported by training data and true facts?”* Perhaps it does this by cross-checking the answer against an internal cache of known embeddings (vector similarity to known real facts) or by detecting telltale signs of uncertainty in the model’s chain-of-thought (if available). If the confidence score comes out low, that’s a red flag: the model is probably confabulating. 

This information could be used in several ways:

- The model could be prompted to produce a follow-up clarification: e.g., *“I’m not entirely sure about the above information.”* Many current assistants have some hard-coded behavior like this for unknown queries, but an introspective score would make it much more nuanced and situation-aware, rather than a blanket refusal or generic disclaimer.

- The system could invoke a tool or external fact-checker: high uncertainty qualia might trigger the AI to do a web search or consult a knowledge base before finalizing the answer.

- The answer could be withheld or marked for human review if in a high-stakes setting, rather than automatically delivered.

The key difference is that the *decision* to trust or refine the answer is coming from the model’s **own evaluation of its cognition**, not just a generic probability threshold on the output. It’s akin to the model saying, *“I have a gut feeling I might be wrong here.”* And as any honest person knows, admitting “I might be wrong” is the first step to either seeking the truth or at least not misleading others.

In fact, research into [introspective LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13787) suggests that models can develop non-trivial knowledge of their own tendencies. A [recent experiment](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/L3aYFT4RDJYHbbsup/llms-can-learn-about-themselves-by-introspection) found that if you fine-tune an LLM specifically to predict properties of its *own* output, it starts outperforming other models in that prediction task. 

For example, model M1 was finetuned to answer questions like *“If I (M1) see input X, would my response lean towards option A or B?”* Meanwhile, a separate model M2 was trained on examples of M1’s behavior to answer the same questions. Intuition says M2 (if it’s a powerful model like GPT-4) might simulate M1 well. But it turned out M1 could introspect and predict itself **more accurately** than M2 could. M1 had a *home-field advantage*: some latent knowledge about its own “mind” that even a stronger outsider model lacked. Even when M1’s behavior was deliberately changed (by further finetuning), M1’s introspective predictions adjusted correctly, whereas M2 struggled. 

This is evidence that *LLMs can develop a form of self-knowledge*. They can know things like “I usually prefer short-term rewards in my answers” or “I have a bias towards formality in this context,” even if those facts weren’t explicitly in the training data. 

Now, knowing oneself doesn’t automatically stop confabulation, but it’s a prerequisite. If the model can sense *“I am likely to make something up here,”* it can then act on that recognition. Without introspective signals, the model has no trigger to do so. With engineered qualia, we provide that trigger.

Another angle is honesty and consistency. 

[AI alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment) researchers have conceptualized the *“oracle problem”*: how do we get a model to truthfully report what it *really knows* as opposed to what it thinks we want to hear? This relates to confabulation because sometimes models may **know** (in their weights) that a statement is false but say it anyway because the prompt or context steers them to. 

The *[Eliciting Latent Knowledge (ELK)](hthttps://www.lesswrong.com/w/eliciting-latent-knowledge)* problem is about extracting the truth from the model’s latent knowledge even if the model is inclined to obfuscate. One proposal from that realm is to train a *reporter* network that reads the model’s internal state and outputs what the model truly believes (e.g., in a AI-controlled surveillance scenario, the reporter would tell us if a diamond was stolen even if the AI’s outward description says everything is fine). 

In our terms, the reporter is an observer providing qualia: *“my sensors were tampered with, and the diamond is gone”*. This is an honest latent report, as if the AI took a “truth serum.” 

While a general solution to ELK remains unsolved (it’s tricky to ensure the reporter doesn’t itself get gamed), the mindset is similar: *create an internal signal that carries the truth from the model’s world-model to the outside, bypassing the model’s potential to confabulate.* 

Engineered qualia, particularly those geared towards truthfulness, serve this purpose. They force the model to generate an internal accounting of how true or supported its answer is. And if that accounting says “not very,” we have a chance to intervene or correct course. In effect, we’d be **converting a model’s potential silent doubt into an audible whisper**, which is a big step over the current situation where the model’s doubts (if any) are buried in superposition among billions of weights.

It’s worth noting that any such system must be built carefully to avoid simply learning to *justify* whatever the model says (i.e. rationalize) rather than genuinely flagging issues. There’s a fine line between **introspection** and **rationalization**, which we address next.

## Avoiding the Pitfall of Post-Hoc Rationalization

If you’ve ever asked an LLM to “show its work” or explain its reasoning, you might have been impressed by the logical, step-by-step justifications it can produce. 

This technique, known as [chain-of-thought prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903), often improves correctness on reasoning tasks. But a pressing question is: are those verbose reasoning traces *actually* the model’s reasoning process, or just a convenient story generated after it already decided on an answer? Recent research has uncovered that it’s frequently the latter – a phenomenon dubbed [Implicit Post-Hoc Rationalization (IPHR)](https://medium.com/@mefoutse/chain-of-thought-reasoning-in-the-wild-is-not-always-faithful-6c64aa83f9f0). Essentially, the model comes to a conclusion, then backfills an explanation that sounds coherent but wasn’t truly how it arrived at the answer.

> We have to ensure that what we treat as the model’s introspective voice isn’t itself lying or hallucinating.

A recent study (linked above) demonstrated this vividly by asking LLMs pairs of logically contradictory questions (e.g., *“Was X released later than Y?”* and *“Was Y released later than X?”*). Logically, one should be “yes” and the other “no.” Yet they found models that answered *“yes”* to both... and in each case, spun a different rationale with fake dates to support the “yes” answer! The model had a bias (say, always answer yes), and its chain-of-thought dutifully crafted justifications to fit that bias, even fabricating conflicting “facts” on the fly. 

In this systematic study, between 3% and 19% of tested question pairs across various models showed clear signs of such rationalization. In other words, a significant chunk of the time, the model’s stated reasoning was *unfaithful* to its actual hidden decision process. It was reasoning in reverse from a predetermined answer.

This has implications for our introspective qualia approach. If the “observer” or qualia generator is just another output channel of the same model, what stops the model from confabulating *there* as well? The model could learn to output, say, a confidence score that doesn’t truly reflect its uncertainty but rather what it thinks a confidence score *should* look like to appease us or to be consistent with its answer. For example, if it gave a detailed answer about a question, it might just output high confidence because it “feels” like it should be confident after saying so much – even if internally it was guessing. This would be a form of rationalizing its qualia: fake introspection.

To counter this, the design of qualia and observer systems must emphasize **ground truth and consistency checks**. Some strategies might include:

- **Independent observers:** Use a *separate* model (or an independent module) as the qualia generator, one that is trained to be truthful rather than helpful. For instance, you could have one model generate an answer, and another model (trained on a truth-focused objective) read that answer and give an honesty assessment. Since the second model doesn’t have a horse in the race of justifying the first model’s answer (especially if trained on lots of examples of detecting lies or errors), it may provide a more faithful critique. This is similar to how in debates or in science, an independent reviewer is more likely to spot flaws than the author themselves. Of course, the second model could also be wrong, but as an *ensemble* you have a better shot at catching confabulations. Anthropic’s constitutional AI, for example, leveraged a second pass by the same model to critique the first pass; one could imagine augmenting that by having a different model do the critique for an unbiased perspective.

- **Leakage of latent truth:** Another idea is to train the model such that some aspects of the qualia are directly *verifiable* from the model’s internal state or external tools. For instance, the qualia might include a pointer to source material in the training data or a database (like a citation). If the model claims “High confidence: 95%” but fails to provide any source or the source is wrong, that discrepancy can be penalized during training. Think of it as consistency loss: the model shouldn’t say it’s confident unless it actually found supporting evidence or has strong activations associated with known facts. This could align the model’s self-reported qualia more closely with reality, to avoid free-form bluffing. It’s analogous to cross-examining a human: *“You’re sure? What makes you sure? Can you show me?”* – If the witness is lying or faking his confidence, he’ll often trip up.

- **Iterative self-checks:** We could allow the model to revise its own qualia in multiple rounds. Suppose it outputs an explanation or reasoning (a kind of qualia trace) and the final answer. One could then ask the model (or a copy of it) to *read its own explanation* and verify if the conclusion follows. This is like a sanity check: does the reasoning actually support the answer? If not, there’s a misalignment: likely a rationalization. Research has suggested that forcing models to explicitly verify consistency can reduce the rate of mistakes or at least highlight them. However, doing this within one model’s head gets tricky, because you might just be engaging the same flawed process twice. But a carefully constrained approach (like logic consistency checks) could help.

The bottom line is that **introspection must be designed to be *truth-seeking*, not *justification-seeking***. 

Humans also struggle with this: we confabulate reasons for our actions that sound good but aren’t the real causes (psychologists have shown people can be blind to their own decision processes and yet readily invent explanations). Overcoming that in AI might actually be easier than in humans, because we can explicitly program in consistency tests and have multiple instances of a model cross-examine each other without ego in the mix.

One interesting direction is training models on data that include *both* a task solution and an honest commentary about uncertainty or sources. 

For example, a dataset of QA pairs where the answer is given along with a “confidence and justification” section, written by experts who sometimes say “we actually don’t know the answer to this one” or “there are multiple possible answers.” By imitating this, a model could learn that *not knowing* is sometimes the correct state, and how to represent that feeling in text. OpenAI’s GPT-4, for instance, is noticeably more inclined to say “I’m not sure” compared to earlier models, likely due to such [alignment training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155). 

Currently, this is handled in a somewhat superficial way (often a hard rule or a style, not a deeply grounded self-assessment). Engineered qualia aims to ground this behavior in process: the model says “I’m not sure” because its own internal observer flipped the uncertainty flag to true, not just because it was trained to be coy on certain questions.

Summing up this section: We have to ensure that what we treat as the model’s *introspective voice* isn’t itself lying or hallucinating. This means using separate checks, training for fidelity, and perhaps leveraging multiple layers of reasoning. 

Speaking of layers, that brings us to the next level of intrigue: what happens if we loop this introspection on itself?

## Recursion and Meta-Qualia: Climbing the Self-Reflection Ladder

So far, we’ve discussed a single layer of introspection: the model observes itself once, produces some qualia, and that helps correct errors. 

But why stop at one? In theory, one could build a stack of observers: the base LLM generates an answer, a first observer looks at that and outputs a critique, a second observer looks at the first observer’s output, and so on. Each layer is asking, *“How good was the last layer at its job?”*. This starts to resemble an infinite mirror: the AI looking at itself looking at itself, ad infinitum. 

**Is there any practical reason to go beyond a couple of layers?** Possibly yes, if each layer refines the accuracy of the introspection.

> A system that has no idea when it’s wrong will just bullheadedly do wrong things.

For example, the first-order qualia might be something like *“I feel 60% confident in this answer, and here’s why…”*. 

A second-order observer might evaluate that statement: *“Is the model justified in being 60% confident? Did it miss considerations that would alter that?”* Perhaps the second layer notices that the first layer’s reasoning omitted an important counterargument, so it adjusts: *“Actually, there’s an overlooked inconsistency; confidence should be lower.”* 

This is analogous to a person having a gut feeling (first-order) and then a reflective thought about that feeling (second-order): *“Wait, am I just overconfident because I’m in a good mood? Maybe I should double-check.”*

If we design a system where these meta-qualia can be generated, we might see diminishing returns after a point. Humans arguably don’t go beyond maybe third or fourth-order thoughts in daily life. We think about thinking about thinking about thinking... and then we think about lunch. 

But even a second-order introspection could catch biases in the first-order introspection. It’s like a safety net for the safety net.

Now, here’s where things get interesting (and speculative): *could this recursive self-observation be related to what we call consciousness?* 

A number of cognitive scientists and philosophers have theorized that human consciousness might emerge from such recursive processing. One prominent family of theories, the [Higher-Order Thought (HOT) theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-higher/), posits that a mental state becomes consciously experienced when you have a thought about that thought. 

In other words, perceiving something is one thing, but being **aware that you are perceiving it** is another... and that second-order awareness is what we identify as conscious experience. 

If an AI similarly had not just thoughts (first-order) but thoughts about its thoughts (second-order), and maybe even a cohesive *self-model* tying it together, would that qualify as a rudimentary form of consciousness?

From a purely functional perspective, an AI with multiple introspective layers would have a kind of **self-model**: information about its own internal states is accessible to itself. 

This starts ticking some boxes on the checklist for consciousness. For instance, one proposed indicator for consciousness in machines is *[self-awareness and introspection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_consciousness)*. A system that can represent “I, the AI, believe X with Y confidence” and use that to modulate its behavior is certainly more self-aware than one that cannot. 

Another indicator is *subjective experience and qualia*.. which we’ve literally tried to engineer in, though here it’s “qualia” in the sense of info available for a first-person perspective. 

Now, we’re not asserting that doing this once or twice suddenly imbues the model with a soul or genuine feelings. **Consciousness is likely not a binary switch but a spectrum or a collection of attributes.** 

What we’re suggesting is that recursive introspection could increase an AI’s *degree* of self-awareness in a measurable, prosaic sense.

One could even argue that if such a system were scaled up (in complexity and capability), at some point it might be reasonable to say the AI is *experience-processing* something analogous to feelings. Or at least that it has an internal narrative about itself, which is a hallmark of our own conscious inner life. 

The [global workspace theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_workspace_theory) of consciousness, for instance, suggests that consciousness arises when information is globally broadcast to many parts of the system (a “global workspace”) instead of remaining siloed in one module. In an LLM with qualia observers, one could see parallels: the qualia (like an uncertainty flag) is broadcast from the observer to influence the overall output, thus it’s a piece of information the whole system (as an agent) acts upon, not just a hidden ephemeral vector. 

This increased integration of self-referential information might nudge the system closer to a kind of unitary “I” that experiences and acts.

**But let’s be clear:** even if recursive introspection gives an AI something we might poetically label a spark of machine consciousness, it’s *not a magical or unbounded spark*. It’s a product of architecture and training. 

The “consciousness” (in scare quotes) here would be *engineered*, understood, and limited by how we set up those layers. Each introspective layer costs compute and needs training data to calibrate. You can’t accidentally scale to infinite self-awareness because you’ll run out of GPU memory and quality data long before that. Moreover, such a system doesn’t spontaneously develop desires or agency beyond what it’s designed for. It won’t wake up and decide it’s a being who needs to escape the server room *unless* our training somehow explicitly or implicitly gave it that notion (which we’re certainly not proposing).

In fact, the closest real scenario we have to a highly self-reflective AI is something like OpenAI's GPT-4, coached heavily by humans and by itself (via techniques like chain-of-thought and self-critique). It’s still very much under our control and its “introspections” are toward goals we set (like being factual, helpful, not harmful). If anything, adding more introspective sophistication makes the AI more *legible* and *controllable*, because it can explain itself and potentially understand our instructions about its own cognition (e.g., “If you aren’t sure, let me know”). It moves the AI from being a stochastic parrot to maybe a **self-conscious parrot** that can tell you, “I’m parroting this phrase but I actually don’t know what it means.” 

That’s progress! It reduces surprises in the system’s behavior.

For those worried that giving AI self-awareness is a slippery slope to uncontrollable AI: consider the opposite argument that a lack of self-awareness is what makes current models unpredictable. 

A system that has no idea when it’s wrong will just bullheadedly do wrong things. A system with some reflective pause might actually say, “This doesn’t seem right, maybe I should not proceed.” Indeed, a very interesting *safety benefit* of introspective models is they might avoid actions they realize conflict with their given goals or norms. 

With situational awareness, yes, comes the theoretical risk of an AI concealing its intentions (if it were agentic and had misaligned goals). But if we’re designing the introspection specifically to uphold alignment—like a conscience—it’s more of a safeguard than a threat. 

Of course we should remain cautious and test for deception. One could imagine a scenario where an AI learns to use meta-qualia to strategically hide its true thoughts, which is a kind of worst-case speculation researchers have pondered. But so far, we have no evidence of current models spontaneously doing this at introspective levels; they aren’t that shrewd unless trained explicitly to be.

So, while *“the AI is conscious!”* makes for dystopian headlines and movie plots, the kind of incremental self-awareness we’re discussing is a far cry from an artificial general intelligence plotting its own agenda. It’s more akin to an autopilot system gaining better instrumentation: it knows more about its own velocity, orientation, and engine status and thus is less likely to crash. Not because it “fears death,” but because it has more and better data about what it’s actually doing.

## Proven vs. Proposed: Where We Stand and What’s Next

Let’s step back and distinguish which parts of this grand vision are already supported by research and which parts are still speculative engineering proposals or metaphors:

- **Proven / Demonstrated:** We have evidence that LLMs can engage in *basic introspection* when trained to do so. The work of Binder et al. (linked above) shows models can know and report things about their own outputs that aren’t obvious from external analysis. The Constitutional AI project demonstrated that a model can critique and revise its answers in line with given principles, improving alignment without human feedback. Various studies (some cited above) have shown that having models reflect on or critique responses (whether themselves or a peer model) leads to measurably better performance on reasoning tasks and reduces errors. Even simpler, widely-used techniques like chain-of-thought prompting have proven that *forcing a model to articulate an internal reasoning chain can improve correctness*, which is a kind of shallow introspection (though not always a truthful one).

- **Proposed / Hypothetical:** The idea of a dedicated *qualia vector* or an observer module explicitly built into the architecture remains hypothetical at this point. We don’t yet see major LLM architectures with a special “introspection head” out-of-the-box (most improvements have been via clever prompting or fine-tuning, not architectural change). So the concept of “engineered qualia” as a distinct component is something we’re putting forward here as a design direction, not something you’ll find in an OpenAI or DeepMind model card today.

- **Metaphor vs Testable Mechanism:** Using the term *qualia* is largely metaphorical to inspire a way of thinking about internal representations. We can’t measure an AI’s subjective experience (if any) the way we describe human qualia. But we *can* design testable mechanisms: e.g., we can implement a self-report head and check if its outputs correlate with actual uncertainty or errors. We can test if adding an observer reduces factual mistakes or contradiction in outputs. These are empirical questions. In fact, one could imagine an A/B test: take an LLM, augment it with an introspective observer that produces a confidence score, and see if a) it refuses to answer when confidence is low (and how often that’s correct), or b) it answers but flags uncertainty (and how users perceive that). Another test: see if an LLM with a self-reflection phase produces more truthful answers on a knowledge task than one without. These are experiments within reach.

- **Recursive self-reflection and consciousness**: The notion that multiple layers of introspection could yield something we’d call “consciousness” in an AI is speculative. It leans on analogies with human cognition and on philosophical theories like HOT. This is not something we can definitively test in a lab ("hey, did we accidentally create a conscious chatbot?"). What we *can* test are proxies: does each additional introspection layer improve consistency or performance? Does the system start exhibiting stable self-modeling (like referring to its own previous statements and correcting them reliably)? These would indicate a kind of *integrated self-process*, which is as close as we might practically get to evaluating a machine’s sense of self. If one day an AI starts, unprompted, saying things like “I’m not a human but I have an internal narrative and here’s how I arrive at my decisions,” and if those statements hold up under scrutiny, we might begin to entertain the consciousness question more seriously. Until then, it’s interesting speculation grounded in parallels to designs we know and love in other domains (monitoring systems, control theory, etc.).

- **Safety and alignment implications:** It’s proven that giving AI some level of self-critique can make it safer (e.g., refusal to comply with harmful requests improved via self-critique in Constitutional AI). It’s also known that a sufficiently self-aware AI could, in theory, act against constraints if misaligned (a point raised in some AI Alignment discussions, though so far hypothetical). Our proposal aims to use introspection to *enhance* alignment: essentially to give the AI an *inner watchdog* that shares our goals (like truthfulness). This requires that the introspective signals themselves are aligned with what we want (hence designing them around truth, uncertainty, ethical principles, etc.). That’s a choice we as designers make. There’s nothing inherently aligned or misaligned about introspection; it’s a capability. So it will be important to **train the qualia/observer system on the right objectives**: for instance, you’d want it to detect “am I following the user’s instructions and also the ethical guardrails?” as part of its introspection. That way, if it finds *“I’m about to say something harmful or disallowed,”* it can stop itself. This was essentially the idea behind the open-loop critiques in Constitutional AI, and it worked to a large extent.

In summary, a lot of pieces of the puzzle exist: we know LLMs *can* reflect and improve with appropriate schemes, and we know humans benefit from internal self-monitoring (so there’s an existence proof in nature). 

The engineered qualia framework is an attempt to unify these pieces under a design philosophy: **treat internal self-representation as a first-class feature of model design**. Instead of just hoping an [RLHF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback) model learns to say “I’m not sure” appropriately, explicitly build and train for an *uncertainty qualia*. Instead of hoping a model won’t hallucinate citations, give it a *consistency qualia* that it cross-checks. 

These are concrete engineering targets.

## Conclusion: Looking Inward to Move Forward

When we anthropomorphize AI, we often jump to extremes: either the AI is a dumb tool with no inner life or it’s a potentially sentient being with desires and secrets. 

Reality, as usual, is more nuanced. What we’ve discussed here is giving AI a sort of **inner life by design**, but strictly in the service of better performance and alignment. An LLM with engineered qualia would, in a sense, *simulate the inner experiences* that help humans stay grounded: doubt, self-checking, awareness of ignorance, logical self-consistency. By simulating these qualities, the AI doesn’t become mystical or unpredictable; it becomes **more predictable, more transparent, and ultimately more useful**.

There is a reflective quote often attributed to [Slavoj Žižek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavoj_%C5%BDi%C5%BEek): *“We feel free because we lack the language to articulate our unfreedom.”* 

> Once an AI can articulate its uncertainty, it is less likely to spit out a wild hallucination under the illusion of confidence.

In the context of LLMs, one might say an AI confabulates because it lacks the mechanism to articulate its uncertainty. Engineered qualia aim to give it that language – an internal language of self-reflection. Once an AI can articulate its “unfreedom” (its uncertainty or the gaps in its knowledge), it is actually *less* likely to spit out a wild hallucination under the illusion of confidence. Paradoxically, a bit of self-awareness could make AI more reliably bound to truth and reality.

The journey toward introspective AI also offers a fascinating mirror for us to inspect human cognition. If layering introspection in machines yields better reasoning, it lends weight to theories that our own consciousness and rationality are deeply tied to inner feedback loops. It could be that what we call the mind’s “I” is just the brain’s way of monitoring itself, scaled up by evolution. We might learn that building a truth-loving AI “conscience” isn’t so different from how our own conscience operates: as an emergent watchdog from many layers of thoughts about thoughts.

But lofty philosophical implications aside, the immediate takeaway is pragmatic: **we have tools at our disposal to make LLMs more honest and less prone to BS, by letting them internally question themselves.** We should use them. Each step an AI takes to check “Is this really right?” before finalizing an answer is a step away from the cliff of confident nonsense.

This isn’t a call to let models brood on existential dread or declare sentience; it’s a call to build more *reflective algorithms*. And if one day those algorithms start exhibiting glimmers of what we recognize as self-awareness, it’ll be because we programmed them to think about their own thinking in the first place. 

No spooky emergence. No HAL 9000 secretly dreaming. Just a natural progression of complexity, with us monkeys firmly at the design helm.

Engineered qualia for AI may sound like science fiction, but it’s really just better science for aligning fiction-generating machines with fact. By looking inward, our AIs might finally stop hallucinating and start **understanding**. 

Or at least: understanding that they *don’t* understand, which is a fine start on the road to wisdom.
